# Health300

Health300 is a health management web application that stores information about a user's heart condition and analyses the inputed information for any irregularities, while also warning the user about it.

This application is suited for those who suffered, are currently suffering or are suspected of having heart problems, and should be used along side doctor intervention and should not be solely used as a medical device.

In addition, the app also has two more features:
  * a daily caloric intake calculator that uses information about the user (such as height, gender, level of activity) to calculate how much a person should eat in one day
  * a health quiz that can be taken by more than one person and also has a leaderboard

The application uses the Bootstrap framework
